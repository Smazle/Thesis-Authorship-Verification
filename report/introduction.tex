\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

In this thesis we work on the problem of authorship verification using texts
written by Danish secondary school pupils. Authorship verification is the
problem of determining whether a text $x$ is written by the same author as the
author of a set of texts $Y$. The usual authorship verification method works by
first extracting features from each $y \in Y$ and from $x$ and then determining
whether or not the author is the same by comparing the features.

    \item CNN's are good at extracting features from low level data.
