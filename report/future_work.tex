% Try a weight function that use actual prediction scores to define time
% weights.

\begin{itemize}

    \item Try applying our methods on other datasets
    \item Writing style development over time i future work.

\end{itemize}

A concern brought up in Section \ref{sec:app_of_method}, regard the
applicability of our current methods to other courses, or even another type
of text data like code for example. Due to the speculatory nature of that
discussion further work within this subject, could well include experimenting
with applying our network design to other types of data. This could include
other go from other high-school classes, such as math or history, to other
educational level, such as elementary school and university.

Another concern brought in Section \ref{sec:app_of_method}, was the inclusion of
citation in the texts provided to our models. Citation are mostly a source of
noise for our models. This makes the most sensible solution, when working with
these models in future, to simply remove the citations before training and
applying the methods.
