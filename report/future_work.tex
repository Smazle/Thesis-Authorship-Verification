\section{Future Work} \label{sec:future_work}

% Try a weight function that use actual prediction scores to define time
% weights.

\begin{itemize}

    \item Try applying our methods on other datasets
    \item Writing style development over time i future work.

\end{itemize}

As the title suggests, this section focuses on the work that we think could
further this project on the future.

A concern brought up in Section \ref{sec:app_of_method}, regard the
applicability of our current methods to other courses, or even another type
of text data like code for example. Due to the speculatory nature of that
discussion further work within this subject, could well include experimenting
with applying our network design to other types of data. This could include
other go from other high-school classes, such as math or history, to other
educational level, such as elementary school and university.
