\section{Data} \label{sec:data}

As described earlier we use data from the Danish company MaCom. The dataset
provided by MaCom is a file consisting of set of texts in Danish where each
text is associated with an author ID. We have been given several text
extractions of different sizes with the biggest dataset consisting of 10,000
texts. Each text in the dataset is rather large and consists of an average of
TODO characters.

% TODO: Describe how we dealt with garbage texts.
The texts we are given are extracted from \textit{.pdf} files and there will
therefore sometimes be garbage included.

% TODO: Describe why we chose 1 / 100000.
