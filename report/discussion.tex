\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion} 

\begin{itemize}

    \item

        Discuss that we would have liked to train an RNN on the character limit
        but that we did not have the computation power.

    \item

        Discuss how comparable our results will be with data in the real world.
        We had no texts written by actual ghost writers so we have no idea how
        our networks would perform on such texts.

\end{itemize}
