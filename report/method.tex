\section{Method} \label{sec:method} 

In this section we will describe the method we have used to solve the Authorship
Verification problem presented. In general there are two methods of representing
each author. There is the instance based approach and the profile based
approach. In the instance based approach each author is represented by a set of
texts they have written while in the profile based approach they are represented
by the sum of the set of texts they have written. The instance based approach is
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:instance_based} and the profile based approach is
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:profile_based}.

        Learning model is trained on the input texts and the model is used to
        predict an unknown text. }

        author are combined using some combination function such as an average
        or a concatenation. Those \textit{profiles} are then given to a Machine
        Learning model to train. The output is a model which is used to predict
        unknown texts. }

We will generally use the instance based approach. The reason we use an instance
based approach is that it allows us to use extra information from each single
text. For example writing style may change over time especially for secondary
school pupils that evolve very much in a short amount of time. Since we use an
instance based approach we are able to weight similarity to newer texts higher
than similarity to older texts.

There are also another split between methods that we consider. There are
generalizing and author specific models. In a generalizing model only a single
model is trained on data from multiple authors and are able to make predictions
about previously unseen authors. In the author specific model a separate model
has to be trained for each author and is not able to make predictions for
previously unseen authors. The generalizing model has several advantages, it
only has to be trained once and after that it can be used for everyone and
it can make use of big data since it can use data from several authors for
training. The author specific model has the advantage that it can better fit
to the specific quirks of a particular author since it is trained separately
for each author. The downside of the author specific approach is that a new
model has to be trained for each new author. We will focus on the generalizing
approach since it is easier to implement for MaCom as they only have to train a
model once.

As a unit of measuring the quality of our models, and how well they adhere to
95\% specificity constraint, we will also compute the number of \gls{TP}s,
\gls{TN}s, \gls{FP}s and \gls{FN}s, as was done in a project previously created
by us.\cite{US} In these problems we get,

\begin{itemize}
    \item a \gls{TP} whenever we answer \textit{True} and the texts are written
        by the same author,
    \item a \gls{TN} whenever we answer \textit{False} and the texts are
        \textbf{not} written by the same author,
    \item a \gls{FP} whenever we answer \textit{True} and the texts are
        \textbf{not} written by the same author,
    \item a \gls{FN} whenever we answer \textit{False} and the texts are written
        by the same author.
\end{itemize}

Given those definitions the \gls{TPR}, \gls{FPR}, \gls{TNR} and \gls{FNR}
describes.

\begin{description}
    \item[\gls{TPR}: ] The fraction of positives that we reported \textit{True}
        on i.e. the fraction of texts written by the same author that we say are
        written by the same author.
    \item[\gls{FPR}: ] The fraction of negatives that we reported \textit{True}
        on i.e. the fraction of texts written by different authors that we say
        are written by the same author.
    \item[\gls{TNR}: ] The fraction of negatives that we reported \textit{False}
        on i.e. the fraction of texts written by different authors that we say
        are written by different authors.
    \item[\gls{FNR}: ] The fraction of positives that we reported \textit{False}
        on i.e. the fraction of texts written by the same author that we say are
        written by different authors.
\end{description}

And they can be computed as,

\begin{align}
    TPR &= \frac{TP}{TP + FN}, \\
    FPR &= \frac{FP}{FP + TN}, \\
    TNR &= \frac{TN}{TN + FP}, \\
    FNR &= \frac{FN}{FN + TP}.
\end{align}

In the case of MaCom, we want to minimize the \gls{FNR} as much as possible, so
as to not wrongfully accuse anyone of not having written their assignment.


\subsection{Deep Learning}

In this paper we will approach the authorship verification/attribution problem
using deep-learning. The term deep learning, was first introduced to
machine machine learning in 1989, and afterward to \gls{NN}'s in 2000. The terms
quickly became synonymous with \gls{NN}'s due to them being some of the more
efficient deep learning methods.\cite{Schmidhuber:2015}

With the inner workings of the brain used as the basis, a standard simple
\gls{NN} consists of a set interconnected processors, called neurons. Each of
these neurons has a real-valued activation associated with it, which activates
differently depending on the specific neuron. The input neurons activate through
perceiving the environment, or in other words, when it is fed data externally.
Other neurons are simply activated through the weighted activation of previous
neurons. More details regarding these weights will be presented later in the
paper.\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Schmidhuber14}

\gls{NN}'s have been around since the 1940's. However, back then they were
merely variations of the linear regressors used at the time, and wasn't
very reminiscent of the Networks on can see today. It wasn't until the
late 1960's, early 70's, that networks comparable to the more modern
approaches surfaced. Examples of such early works, are the two publications
\cite{ivakhnenko1973cybernetic} and \cite{4308320}, which describe multi-layered
feed-forward supervised neural network architectures. While the work described
in \cite{4308320} was indeed one of the first cases of the modern \gls{NN},
actually getting the network to learn was still a problem, as the tweaking of
individual weights attributed to each neuron in the network wasn't trivial.
Little did they know, research to solve that problem was already in progress.
The basics of continuous \gls{BP} was initially described in 1960, in
\cite{Kelley1960}, quickly followed by a simpler approach which used only the
chain rule in 1962, \cite{DREYFUS196230}. It wasn't until 1970 that the modern
version of \gls{BP} was described, using automatic differentiation as its
basis. With this, the increase in research of usages of \gls{BP} increased the
following decades. As the computational power increased several 1000 folds in
the 90's and 2000's, so did the practical usage of \gls{BP}, and \gls{NN} in
general\cite{Schmidhuber:2015}. The real life application of \gls{BP}, will be described
in section \ref{sec:BP}

Like with the history of authorship attribution, research in this area of
science picked up more interest, as we entered the modern computational age,
and with the introduction of the \gls{CNN}. \gls{CNN}s bases themselves on
the early work described in \cite{TJP:TJP19681951215}. They showed that cats
and monkeys visual cortexes contain a set of neurons, each individually
responding to a receptive field, or area, of their field of view. Neighboring
receptive fields all have a certain amount of overlap, however in the end
a cohesive view is created. This is what paved the way for neocognition in
1980\cite{Fukushima1980}, the basis of \gls{CNN}'s, which works in a very
similar manner, looking at overlapping subsections of data. These convolutional
neurons however were rarely used alone, but together with a down-sampling neuron
such as Max Pooling introduced in 1993.\cite{Schmidhuber:2015}

\subsubsection{Neurons}

As mentioned previously a \gls{NN} consists of a collection of neurons. Each
neuron is a simplified mathematical model, which behaves much like neurons in
the brain would, receiving, processing and transmitting data/information. Each
neuron has a set of inputs called $x_i$ and a single output called $z_i$. The
neurons compute a weighted sum of its inputs and applies an activation function
$h$ to the weighted sum. The weights are called $w_i$. The function each neuron
computes is then,

\begin{equation}
    z_i = h\left(
        \sum_{i = 1}^d w_ix_i + w_0
    \right).
\end{equation}

The training of a \gls{NN} consists of changing the weights applied at each
neuron, with the goal of modeling the relationships present in the data.

\subsubsection{Backpropagation}\label{sec:BP}
The actual modeling and learning that the \gls{NN} does, can be attributed
to \gls{BP}. It by this process, that the weight in our \gls{NN} are updated,
signifying the learning the network does. The process can be split into three
steps, which are continuously repeated:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Feed Forward
    \item Back Propagate
    \item Update Weights
\end{enumerate}
When starting out, we have a set of our starting weight. As to how these weights
are initialized is up to the user. At this point steps 


TODO: More details needed here


\subsubsection{Activation Functions}
The activation function $h$, used at each neuron, defines the output of the
node given a certain input. A simple example of this would be computer chip
circuit, which can be seen as a series of activation functions outputting 0 or
1 depending on their input. This activation function would be a linear one.
When applying activation functions to neurons in \gls{NN}s, they are usually
non-linear, as it allows for the computation of more complex problems using a
smaller amount of neurons, relative to usage of a linear activation function,
as they allow for the universal function approximation, a point also made by
\cite{6797088}

A plot of different activation functions is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:activation_functions}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \textbf{Activation Functions}\par\medskip
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./pictures/method/activation_functions.png}
    \caption{Different activation functions that can be used in neural
        networks.}
    \label{fig:activation_functions}
\end{figure}

Each activation function has its pros and cons. We mainly made use of the
\gls{ReLu} activation function in the hidden layers of our networks. The
reason for this selection is its general purpose use. When selecting an
activation function for your neurons, the best function would be the one which
best approximates the underlying function. Without a good idea as to what
that function might be, \gls{ReLu} is a good starting point. Its simplicity
provides a quick computation time, and its below zero limitation means that a
large portion of the network won't be activating, resulting in an even smaller
computation time. In addition to that, the derivative of the function is 1
in the case of a positive input, resulting in the \gls{BP} loss having equal
influence throughout the network. In the case of other activation functions,
this might not be the case, resulting in an altering of the error as we
propagate backwards through the network. This could lead to a big error in the
deeper layers not reaching the shallow layers of the network. This property of
the \gls{ReLu} activation function, does however not come without its costs.
If the learning rate of the network isn't configured correctly, a \gls{ReLu}
activated neuron might be blasted with a gradient so large, that it never
reaches a point of activation again. In other words, the neuron "dies". As
such, one can risk a network containing a lot of dead non-activation neurons,
thus greatly decreasing its quality. On the other hand the sigmoid function,
doesn't allow its neurons to die. It can become victim to saturation. In
the case of weight being too small or too high, the output values will be
placed at the far ends of the sigmoid range of values. At this point the
gradient is incredibly small, meaning that the contribution that neuron now has
is negligible. This neuron is now only a strain on the network, slowing it
down through its activation, but contribution nothing, a problem \gls{ReLu}
does not have. Its based on these considerations we chose the \gls{ReLu}
activation function, leaving us the task of properly selecting our learning
rate.\cite{JiYan, AndrejKarpathy, AvinashSharmaV}

As the activation function of our output neurons we have generally
used the softmax function. The softmax function is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:softmax_activation}. The function is defined as

\begin{equation}
    h(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{k=1}^n e^{x_k}}, \text{for $i = 1 \dots n$}.
\end{equation}

The softmax function takes any vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and returns a vector
$y \in (0, 1)^n$. Where the sum of the output vectors elements will be equal to
1. The function is therefore great at constructing a probability distribution
based on an input vector. Each individual value in the vector get a high
probability if the value is high and a low probability if the value is low.
Therefore the function is often used at the end of networks to get the
probability of each class in a classification problem.

\subsection{Baseline Methods}

In order to gauge the efficiency of our deep learning approaches, we have
chosen to implement some baseline methods. These methods were picked
based on their performance in a previous project written by us as well,
\cite{US}. Albeit that project was only concerned with English texts
provided by the \cite{pan:2015}, and \cite{pan:2014} text forensics tasks,
we hypothesize that the performance of these approaches will perform just
as well on Danish texts when being tuned for the Danish language.


\subsubsection{Extended Delta Method}

One of the best performing methods of \cite{US} was the extended delta method.
As the name suggests the method extends the already existing delta method
described by \cite{evert2015towards}. The normal delta methods consists of first
extracting word frequencies from all texts and using these as the describing
features. After doing this to the entire sample space of texts, and applying a
linear transformation to their respective feature-sets, \gls{KNN} is then used
to determine the author of the introduced texts based on its closest neighbors
in the word-frequency feature-space. The extended delta method, simply expands
on the set of possible features to pick from, rather than being limited to only
using the word-frequencies of the text.


\subsubsection{Author Specific SVM}

Another algorithm used in \cite{US}. Heavily inspired by \cite{hansen2014}
starts out by fetching all texts known to be written by a specific author and an
equal number of texts known not to be written by that same author. It is upon
the feature-set extracted from these texts that a \gls{SVM} is trained, allowing
it to learn the specific author's writing style from the known texts supplied
and in contrast what the writing style of someone not him is. When a new text,
with disputed authorship is presented the hope is that the trained \gls{SVM}
will be able to determine if the author it was trained on, is in fact the author
of this new text as well.
