\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

We have finally reached the point where we can determine the unbiased accuracy
our different models. To do this we will make use of the (D) data-set. Just
to reiterate the details contained in Section \ref{sec:data}, this data set
consists of last 3558 authors available to us, where none of these authors are
repeated in any of the other sets.

We have 5 models which we are going to apply to this test data-set,
our two baseline methods, the character-level \gls{CNN}, the sentence
level RNN, and the character-word-level \gls{CNN}.

Starting with the baseline methods, we made use of the features and the
hyper parameters that provided best on the training set.
For the Extended Delta method, this was a K value, and a p value of 1.
