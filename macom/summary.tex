    \section{Introduction}

    During the last 6 months we have created a system designed to determine if a
    secondary school student possibly made use of a ghostwriter. Throughout this
    description we will call this process authorship Verification . This system
    is intended be a tool that assists teacher in more accurately determining
    the authenticity of an assignment, while also providing a description of
    what factors contributed to the decision the system made.

    The goal we set out to meet was keeping the amount of false accusation under
    10\%, while catching 95\% of the students who made use of a ghostwriter.
    Keeping a low amount of false accusation was the primary goal of the two,
    meaning that it would be acceptable if sacrificed the amount of students we
    caught if resulted in a low amount of false accusations.

    \section{Data}
    The data used for the creation of this system was provided by MaCom.
    We made use a set consisting of 10.000 authors, spread across several
    different schools, and school courses.


     
    \section{The System}
    
    The way the our system works is when a student hands in an assignment,
    the assignment ($t$) and the student ID ($\alpha$) is given to our system.
    The assignment $t$ is then compared to each of the assignment previously
    created by $\alpha$, each producing a score indicating how alike the two
    assignments are.

    It then takes a weighted average over these likeness scores. 
    The best way to perform this weighing was determined on a subset of
    the 10.000 authors we were provided.
